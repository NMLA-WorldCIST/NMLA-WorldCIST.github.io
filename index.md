Networks are ubiquitous in many real-life domains and applications: basically whenever/wherever there exists a relationship between two entities, we can talk about networks. The type of entities can be people (in which case we talk about social networks), proteins (biological networks), computers/routers/printers (computer networks), railway stations (transportation networks), etc. Entities can 
be characterized by their attributes (attributed networks), can be of different types (heterogeneous), can appear/disappear/change (them or their relations) over time (dynamic) etc.

Lately, quite extensive research focus has been put in different directions related to studying different types of networks and various research problems and challenges associated with them. This workshop focuses on three such directions.

First, it is important to understand the role of network modeling (also known as network design or network engineering). Although the 
majority of real life problems relate to network data, this does not necessary mean that the actual data is provided in the form of a network. This frequently requires transforming implicitly given network data into an explicit network and that does not necessarily mean that this transformation is always a unique one. In those cases, opting for a particular choice to model a network could significantly influence the outcome. Furthermore, modeling a network in a most straightforward way does not have to be the most optimal solution. Therefore, we seek for solutions which propose creative yet effective network models for solving particular applications. 

Second, generating ad hoc/hand-crafted features based on the network structure or attributes is slowly but steadily fading away. Instead, there is a tremendously increasing tendency of performing network featurization in an automated way, primarily using representation learning methods. The latter attempt at learning representations of different parts of network: nodes, edges, sub-networks or even entire networks, typically with the goal of using learnt representation for downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction or graph completion. However, despite a growing number of studies, research community is still facing a number of challenges e.g. how to learn the high quality representations in an efficient way on extremely large networks. Additionally, different network types bring along different challenges. Papers not only proposing novel algorithms and methods for addressing these challenges but also shedding light on how learnt representations could be used in concrete applications are of particular interest in this workshop. 

Third, network analysis has demonstrated many benefits and provided many valuable insights in different application areas. However, growing amounts of data and appearance of different types of networks and underlying latent aspects, forces researchers to constantly innovate and adjust their perspectives on apparently known problems. Topics of interest in this stream range from discovering interesting patterns, detecting communities, via sampling and evaluation to network alignment, summarization and visualization.

## <a name="Submission"></a> Submission

Two types of papers can be submitted to NMLA workshop (both will be published at the Springer AISC proceedings):

* Full papers: Finished or consolidated R&D works. These papers are assigned a 10-page limit.

* Short papers: Finished or consolidated R&D works and also ongoing work but with relevant preliminary results, open to discussion. These papers are assigned a 7-page limit.

Submissions must be in PDF, written in English and must follow the formatting rules for Proceedings in Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing Series (see Instructions for Authors at Springer Website).

<!---
The version of papers for evaluation by the Program Committee, saved in PDF format, must not include identification, e-mail and affiliation of the authors. This information must only be available in the camera-ready version of accepted papers, saved in Word or Latex format and also in PDF format. 

To submit or upload a paper please go to: 
-->


All workshop papers will have three independent blind reviews or in special cases two independent, non-conflicting and detailed reviews.

Accepted full and short papers will be included in the workshop proceedings. In order to be published, as in the main conference, workshop papers must be registered and presented at the conference. 
<!---
Camera-ready version of accepted papers must include identification, e-mail and affiliation of the authors and it must be accompanied by the Consent to Publish form filled out, in a ZIP file, and uploaded at the conference management system.
-->

The workshop proceedings will be published by Springer in a book of the AISC series. Proceedings will be submitted for indexation by ISI Thomson, SCOPUS, DBLP, EI-Compendex among several other scientific databases. Extended versions of best selected papers will be published in journals indexed by ISI/SCI, SCOPUS and DBLP. Detailed and up-to-date information may be found at WorldCist'20 website:

Budva, Montenegro

NMLA 2020 (and WorldCIST'20) will take place at 5-star Hotel Splendid Conference & SPA Resort, located in Bečići – a picturesque bay with the cleanest waters, surrounded by a coniferous forest and beautiful mountains. A seaside promenade connects it with Budva, the old town, while its restaurants and nightclubs are only 2 km away.
